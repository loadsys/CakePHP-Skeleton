# This is the master project provisioning configuration file.
#
# Its purpose is to provide environment-specific information on
# external server dependencies that the project requires to run,
# such as server IP, hostname, installed packages, etc. It's
# designed to simplify the provisioning process for both vagrant
# dev environments and production instances. It mirrors the
# environment-aware `app-*.php` configs loaded by Cake in
# bootstrap.php.
#
# The full set of config keys used in provisioning must be defined
# in this file. @TODO: Additional override keys may be defined in separate
# files named after the matching APP_ENV. For example:
# `provision-staging.yaml` and/or `provision-local.yaml`. Values
# from those files will be deep-merged on top of this one during
# bootstrapping.
