# Loadsys Cake Command Line Scripts #

This collection of scripts is intended to provide consistency and shortcuts for common project tasks. Key tools are highlighted and described below.

## Installation ##

*WARNING!* These scripts are currently only compatible with Cake 2.x. Don't try to use them on a 1.x project (yet).

The scripts all expect to live together in a subfolder of your project root named `bin/`. To install them, navigate to your project root and run:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/loadsys/bin.git bin
```

## Getting Updates ##

To pull any recent changes to the script library into your project, just run:

```bash
git submodule update
```

## Contributing Improvements ##

1. Checkout a copy of the Loadsys CakePHP-Skeleton, which includes this project as a submodule.
